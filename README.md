source ~/miniconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh
conda install mamba -n base -c conda-forge
```

```
eval "$(mamba shell hook --shell bash)"
mamba activate metaflow-dev
source metaflow_env/bin/activate

metaflow-dev shell

eval "$(mamba shell hook --shell bash)"
mamba activate metaflow-dev
source metaflow_env/bin/activate

pip install -r requirement.txt
```

Now you can run your app and watch the pipeline every time you type
